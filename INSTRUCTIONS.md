# Project Instructions

## Overview  
This project analyzes over 500,000 Amazon food product reviews to test whether negative reviews are more emotionally charged and lexically repetitive compared to positive ones. It uses Type-Token Ratio (TTR) and negative sentiment intensity as linguistic measures.

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you will need:

### 1. R (version â‰¥ 4.0 recommended)  
Download and install from: https://cran.r-project.org/

### 2. RStudio (optional but recommended)  
Download and install from: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

### 3. Required R Packages  
The script installs missing packages automatically, but you can also install them manually:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "tidytext", "sentimentr", "lubridate"))
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Download the Dataset**

3. **Run the Script**
   - Run the full script from top to bottom. It will:
     - Load and preprocess the data
     - Calculate lexical diversity and sentiment metrics
     - Run statistical tests
     - Generate visualizations
     - Output regression results and conclusions
